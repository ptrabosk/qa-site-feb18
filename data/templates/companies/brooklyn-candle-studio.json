      "content": "I apologize that your experience with our product hasn't been enjoyable so far. There are a few reasons that you may be experiencing a more subtle scent throw than you thought would occur. The first reason is the soy wax itself - because we use natural soy wax, our candles will not have the same scent throw as paraffin candles. Soy wax is known to have a much lighter scent throw than paraffin or other wax blend candles. It's natural qualities can also lead to variances from batch to batch. Room size can also affect the scent throw - our products were initially created with small New York apartments in mind, so they might not be super strong in a larger house or room. A fainter scent throw could also be due to the cure time. If this candle was just recently poured, the fragrance may not have yet completely bound with the wax. If this is the case, you could wait a few more days before lighting it again. Lastly, our abilities to perceive fragrance vary wildly from person to person. Some people are highly sensitive while others lack the ability to perceive certain scent notes. In order to create a balance, our fragrances are meant to work for all kinds of people.",
