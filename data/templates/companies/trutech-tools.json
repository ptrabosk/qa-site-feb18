      "content": "The Testo 550 digital HVAC gauges are not a vacuum manifold in the traditional sense, but they can be used for vacuum measurements during system evacuation, which is why there's some confusion. \n\nWhat the Testo 550 does:\nMeasures refrigerant pressures (high and low side)\nCalculates superheat and subcooling\nIncludes temperature sensors (usually clamp probes)\nHas a built-in vacuum sensor, so it can monitor vacuum levels during evacuation (down to about 500 microns\n\nWhat it doesn't do (as a full vacuum manifold):\nIt does not have a wide flow path like a dedicated vacuum manifold or vacuum-rated core removal tools do.\nIt's not ideal for pulling a deep vacuum quickly - it restricts flow compared to using large-diameter vacuum hoses and proper evacuation tools.\nCan measure the vacuum during evacuation\nNot optimized for pulling a vacuum efficiently\n\nRecommendation:\nUse the Testo 550 to monitor the vacuum, but use dedicated vacuum-rated hoses and core removal tools for the actual evacuation process.",
