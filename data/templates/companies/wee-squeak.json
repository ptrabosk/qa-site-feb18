Be sure to never wear Wee Squeak shoes in sandboxes or at the beach. Sometimes the foam in the heel blocks the air from escaping the hole and prevents the squeaking. Remove the squeaker and place a ballpoint pen (or something similar) in the squeaker outlet. Push the foam towards the back of the shoe with the pen. This should fix the problem.",
