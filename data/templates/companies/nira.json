Our laser technology works by penetrating through the epidermis (outer skin) at a wavelength of 1450 nm to gently heat up the dermis to stimulate natural collagen production for younger-looking skin.\n\nLYMA is not FDA-cleared or clinically validated specifically for wrinkle reduction like the NIRA is. LYMA's strength is more in skin tone, redness, and inflammation, whereas NIRA focuses on collagen stimulation and visible wrinkle reduction.",
