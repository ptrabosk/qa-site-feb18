You can check out how it works here: https://www.customgoldgrillz.com/pages/layaway-policy The gist of it is you can lock in the price of your piece and you just have to put in a 10% initial deposit. Best thing about this is no approval or assessments required and it is interest free. You have the flexibility on how much and when you can for the remaining amount (up to 365 days depending on the amount of your order).
